PLEASE TAKE A TIME TO READ IMPORTANT NOTES AT THE END OF THIS README.MD FILE:
Sales and product management App with Laravel and Filament

Files and folders that can be automatically generated — such as those inside the public directory created by Filament — have been excluded from the Git repository.

To regenerate them after deployment, run:

composer install
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-assets
npm install
npm run build  # or 'vite build' depending on your setup
